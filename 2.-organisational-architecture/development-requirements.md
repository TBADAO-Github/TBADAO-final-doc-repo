# Development requirements

Onboarding:

* note to self: "gating" to the DAO through a Gitcoin passport holding the following stamps: Proof-of-Humanity, Github account, and discord account.

Communication:

* note to self: check a decentralised alternative to Discord / Discours here: [https://app.orbis.club/group/kjzl6cwe1jw149awlukp9qmgerrpmcdqwntqis1uqoe6zs3nf6lubc9mlgpk1v5/kjzl6cwe1jw14bgv27svcrulzxl1gc8pv8dn72oiaz4waqdwoixeok0h6312bc3](https://app.orbis.club/group/kjzl6cwe1jw149awlukp9qmgerrpmcdqwntqis1uqoe6zs3nf6lubc9mlgpk1v5/kjzl6cwe1jw14bgv27svcrulzxl1gc8pv8dn72oiaz4waqdwoixeok0h6312bc3)

Governance:

* find solution for: 1 person, one vote through Soul Bound Tokens or [https://app.proofofhumanity.id/](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/)
* General Assembly holds all the voting DAO members and has as first powers:
  * Allocation and retraction of use of keys for executors (e.g. treasury keys, operational management
    * the DAO should have an online governance module that implements automatically the key allocation and retraction decisions from the general assembly&#x20;

User journey:

* The user chooses if (s)he participates in ONE of the following capacities:
  * Contributor
  * Contributor AND Governance-participant
* Starting point = user's public address (e.g. 0x39FE3eEEDD9F986209208b85B4e5e469b5Ea318d)
  * Complemented by a Sybil attack solution such that each contributor to TBA DAO can have only one public address to participate within the governance of TBA DAO (proof of humanity? Proof of uniqueness?
* NOTE TO SELF: Github is the primary collaboration tool. To access, a contributor needs an account. How compatible is the identification in this account with the pseudonymity of the user's public address? How do both of these "identifiers" relate to each other? Do they need a connection, or can they exist independently?
